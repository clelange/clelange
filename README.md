### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an experimental particle physicist at [CERN](https://home.cern) working on the [CMS experiment](https://cms.cern). I'm looking for heavy particles that might be hiding in the collisions of the Large Hadron Collider ([LHC](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider)). I have a great interest in automating workflows.
